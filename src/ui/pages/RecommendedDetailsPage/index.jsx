              dawn of civilization, providing the vital link between the soil

              evolved, so did the field of agricultural economics as a dynamic
              discipline that wields the power to reshape the world food system.

              When does chronic migraine become refractory?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Experts do not universally agree on the criteria for diagnosing
              refractory migraine. But doctors commonly use the International
              Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3) when
              trying to distinguish refractory migraine from other types of
              migraine. The ICHD-3 is a diagnostic manual for the treatment of
              migraine. According to the ICHD-3, it can even be difficult to
              distinguish chronic migraine from episodic migraine since
              continuous headaches aren’t easily distinguishable from one day to
              the next. In general, though, the ICHD-3 uses the term “chronic”
              when a person has 15 or more headache days per month, with 8 of
              them confirmed as migraine. Despite the differing criteria, a 2019
              review outlines several things doctors can look for when trying to
              diagnose refractory chronic migraine based on ICHD guidelines:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 pl-3">
              <li>
                Preventive treatments have failed: Several preventive
                treatments aim to reduce your number of migraine episodes.
                There’s no consensus on how many of these treatments need to
                fail before a doctor diagnoses refractory migraine, but the
                range seems to be between two and five. In this case, “failure”
                can mean two things: The drug doesn’t reduce your migraine
                frequency or severity, or you can’t tolerate the drug because of
                side effects. .
              </li>
              <li>
                Alternative therapies have failed: If you’ve tried things like
                acupuncture or biofeedback to reduce your migraine and it hasn’t
                helped, this also informs your diagnosis
              </li>
              <li>
                Doctors have considered medication overuse headache (MOH): Some
                people with chronic migraine take pain relief medication almost
                daily to function. But this can cause withdrawal symptoms,
                including headache, when the medication wears off or they stop
                taking it. Some experts think doctors should treat MOH and rule
                it out as a source of migraine before diagnosing refractory
                migraine, while others disagree.
              </li>
            </ul>
